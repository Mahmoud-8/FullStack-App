# Feedback: 
- Check comments in the readme file
- Something is off with the routing, 
- You can merge the pages and components folders (no difference in content), I reccoment you keep the components folder and move the `Checkout` and `Product` here. (After this you need to update imports as well)
- `Footer` 
  - add links in the `a` tags
  - Create separate files for the svgs and import them in the footer.( Improves readability)
- `Form` 
  - Add validation to the form. It should not be possible to send an empty form field.

- `ProductCard` - looks good
- `ThankYouMessage` - looks good
- `Checkout` - Formatting!
- `Product` - what is the difference between `Product` and `ProductCard`?
